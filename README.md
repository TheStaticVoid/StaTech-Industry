## Installation
I recommend the use of [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) for handling modded installs. The following instructions assume you have Prism installed with your Minecraft account signed in already. To install the latest version of StaTech Industry, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/TheStaticVoid/StaTech-Industry/releases) and download the .zip of the latest version.
2. In the Prism Launcher, click "Add Instance" then select the "Import from zip" tab on the left. Navigate to where you downloaded the .zip and click Ok.
3. You will be prompted with a menu describing that some mods are blocked from download on third-party launchers. Add the folder you use as your downloads folder using `Add Download Folder` button, then click `Open Missing` to open the mod downloads. Save them to your downloads and they will be detected by the launcher.
4. Click "Ok" and allow for the process to finish. 
5. Click "Edit" under the StaTech Industry instance and ensure you have at least 4-6 GB or RAM dedicated to the pack, as well as your version of Java is Java 17.
