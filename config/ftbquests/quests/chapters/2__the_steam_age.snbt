			description: ["The &aRedstone Control Module&r is an upgrade for your machines that allows you to control when they run using &credstone&r. By defualt, the module is operating with &6High Power&r. This means that the machine &bwill not run&r unless it's given a &cRedstone signal&r. You can invert this by &3shift+right clicking&r the &aRedstone Control Module&r in your hand. Doing so puts it in &6Low Power&r mode, which means the machine &bwill only run&r when not powered by a &cRedstone signal&r."]
